Pigeon README


REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Pigeon requires that Perl and various Perl libraries, in addition to the GD and
ImageMagick graphics library be installed.

Perl binaries for various platforms can be found here:

  http://www.perl.org/get.html


The source code for GD can be found here:

  http://www.libgd.org

The source code for ImageMagick can be found here:

  http://www.imagemagick.org

To download the Perl libraries, the easiest method is to use CPAN by issuing
the following commands:

  cpan

  cpan> install Bio::SearchIO

  cpan> install File::Temp

  cpan> install GD

  cpan> install GD::Graph

  cpan> install Image::Magick

  cpan> install IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress

  cpan> exit

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

To build the Pigeon module, issue the commands:

  perl Build.PL

  ./Build

  ./Build install

The Pigeon module will be installed in your Perl modules directory.

You can find scripts for using the module in the scripts/ directory.  The
parse.pl script will parse through a BLAST output file for relevant data,
and output it in a tab delimited form that Pigeon can interpret.
